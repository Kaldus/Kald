This is designed for fast paced beginners/intermediaries to get a good gist of some key Javascript functionality as they dive in. Good for folks who know HTML/CSS and perhaps have used jQuery, but not quite familiar with raw Javascript.

The file is commented throughout to detail pretty much every single step of the way. I picked functionality that is aimed at getting one to at least understand Javascript relatively well; from one file.
