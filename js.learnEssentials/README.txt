- js_essentials_kald.js -


This is designed for fast paced beginners/intermediaries to get a good gist of some key Javascript functionality as they dive in. Good for folks who know HTML/CSS and perhaps have used jQuery, but not quite familiar with raw Javascript.

The file is commented throughout to detail pretty much every single step of the way. I picked functionality that is aimed at getting one to at least understand Javascript relatively well; from one file.

1. Set up an HTML file and plug the javascript into it.

2. Create a button to match the main function.

3. Search the js_essentials_kald.js for the string "getElementById". Create DOM elements in the HTML file to match any line of "getElementById". They are all coded in as simple paragraphs, you will just have to assign an (id="idname") to match in your HTML.

Feel free to change the names to what you want, remember to change them in the js file as well as the HTML file that you created to match up.
