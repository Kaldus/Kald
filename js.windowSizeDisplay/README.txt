Anything within *s like... *text*... means you can replace everything within and include the *s with whatever you decide to name it.


- screen_size.js -

A simple js function snippet that displays the current browser page dimensions (width and height), it adjusts in real time as the window is resized. Good for responsive testing.

You can plug this javascript into your site, create an element with the ID "*idName*" (the default is sw) for it to write to. Then call the script with with an input or button with an onclick="*functionname*" (the default is screenS) attribute.

- Display changes to red once browser width is or greater than 1024px wide, otherwise, it will be blue if less than 1024px wide.
