- js.changeUrl -

A neat script for pulling document location and dropdown values to modify and fwd to a modified URL based on the dropdown value as well as manipulating some parts of the existing uRL itself. Great for the occassion of having to make dynamic links from dropdowns without manually assigning URLs for each dropdown selection.
